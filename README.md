# ðŸ“Œ Design Patterns

> *This project is a collection of various Design Patterns used in Java. A separate package is going to be created for each design pattern example. E.g. if a "Builder" design pattern is added, it will be placed into the "builder" package.*

## ðŸš€ Design Patterns added so far:
- ðŸ”¹ Builder: used to construct complex objects step-by-step while ensuring immutability and readability. It separates object creation from its representation, allowing controlled, flexible object instantiation.
- ðŸ”¹ Type-safe enum: provides a way to define a fixed set of constant objects with unique behavior and properties, ensuring compile-time type safety and extensibility compared to traditional constants (static final variables).
- ðŸ”¹ Factory: provides a way to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client. It encapsulates object creation and allows for dynamic object selection based on input parameters.
  - Simple Factory
  - Factory with Spring Dependency Injection
- ðŸ”¹ Facade: exposes only a simplified API to the client while hiding the complexity of the underlying system.
